This project is my oven version of the famous snake game.
The player can chose between 3 different speed levels.
There is also a so called chaos mode which will generate 3 different kind of special effect items.</br></br>
<strong>shrink</strong> makes the snake body shrink by a random number in a defined range</br>
<strong>grow</strong> makes the snake body grow by a random number in a defined range</br>
<strong>extra points</strong> adds or remove points by a random number in a defined range</br></br>
This special effect items are shown as green rectangles.
Regular food items are shown as red rectangles.
